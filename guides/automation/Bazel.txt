Bazel is an open-source Google build and test tool similar to Make, Maven, and Gradle. 
It uses a human-readable, high-level build language. Bazel is aimed to build “code quickly and reliably” 
Bazel supports projects in multiple languages and builds outputs for multiple platforms. 
Bazel supports large codebases across multiple repositories, and large numbers of users. 
In comparison to Makefiles, Bazel provides higher-level concepts such as “Java test”, “C++ binary”, the notions of “target platform” and “host platform”, etc.

Bazel offers the following advantages:

High-level build language
Bazel is fast and reliable
Bazel is multi-platform
Bazel is extensible to any language and framework.
